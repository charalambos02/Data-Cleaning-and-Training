To run the file run it from Jupiter notebook or with any other way.
Everything was completed but I dint want to spend much time on data visualisation.
I know its important and I know how to create amazing graphs but I wanted to finish

Also I have build both machine learning model (multiple linear regressions) and deep learning model(Keras).
